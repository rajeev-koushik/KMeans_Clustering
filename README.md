# KMeans_Clustering
In this short and simple project, I was aiming at applying and learning more about the KMeans clustering algorithm. I chose this as the first step in the journey to learning more about unsupervised ML models.

Here, I have worked on the popular 'iris.csv' dataset. I have performed two iterations to get an accurate plot of all the entities.

In the first iteration, I chose the number of clusters as 5. Then, I plotted an Elbow graph to get a better idea of how many clusters to give as the input.
In the second iteration, I chose the input as 3 based on the curve from the Elbow graph and then I created a scatter plot as the final output.
